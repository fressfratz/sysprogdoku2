\subsection{Grammar}
The parser has to evaluate the grammar shown in table \ref{table:grammar}. Therefore first and follow sets are used. The follow set \texttt{follow(T)} contains all terminals that might appear right after the terminal \texttt{T}. The first set \texttt{first(T)} on the other hand, contains all legit terminals which may first appear with a specific grammar rule.\\
With the knowledge of those sets the order of the tokens can be checked during the recursive descent.

The functionality of the grammar class is to calculate these first and follow sets of a specific rule.
